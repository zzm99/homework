### 1、Program with machine language according to the following c.

int_8 a = 1;
int_8 c = a + 3;

#### 1）Write your assembly code & machine code : 
LOD # 1 , STO X , LOD X , ADD # 3 , STO Y , HLT .

#### 2）Explain machine code execution with the fetch-decode-execute cycle: 
Main memory –> fetch instruction –> Decode instruction –>Registers –>Get data –>Execute the instruction –> Main memory

#### 3）Explain functions about IR, PC, ACC registers in a CPU:

IR: instruction register used to save an instruction currently executing.         
PC: program counter, which stores the address of the next instruction in memory.      
ACC: Accumulative register that provides a workspace for ALU to temporarily store ALU results when the ALU performs all arithmetic and logic operations.      

#### 4）Explain physical meaning about vars a & c in a machine: 

a and c carry out and operate

### 2、简答题

#### 1）What are stored in memory?： 

Instruction and data 

#### 2）Can a data or a instruction stored in the same place?

Yes.

#### 3） Explain Instruction Format with example instructions.:

ADD X :00000000 10000000 : The first eight bits are instruction, the fourth bits are addressing modes, 0 in the example, indicating that the operand is the content of the address; the last eight bits are operands, indicating a value or address, and the memory address 128 in the example. The whole example represents the addition of data in memory address 128. 

### 3、解释以下词汇

#### 1）汇编语言（Assembly Language）:

A language that uses mnemonic codes to represent machinelanguage instructions

#### 2）编译（Compiler）:

A program that translates a high-level language program into machine code

#### 3）命令式语言（Imperative programming）:

Imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program’s state

#### 4）函数编程语言（Functional programming）:

Functional programming is a programming paradigm–a style of building the structure and elements of  computer programs–that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoid changing-state and mutable data

#### 5）过程式编程（Procedural programming）:

A programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call
